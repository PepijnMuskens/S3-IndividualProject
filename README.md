<h1>0 My Individual Project:</h1>

For my individual project I have desided to create a bingo game in which users can make challenges based on statistics of steam games. when a game has a lot of challenges users can use these challenges to create a bingocart. You can select your own bingocart, start a game and invite friends to play along with the same card. The first player to complete a row of challenges wins the game. 

### 1 You design and build user-friendly, full-stack web applications:
 
For The backend of my project I use microservices, this way I can run the game and the creating of the bingocarts on diffrent servers. For the frontend I will be using vue because it is a new skill I want to learn and a lot of peolpe in my class will be able to help me if i run into any problems. 
After a few days of making some test projects i learned the basics of vue. My backend was a lot easyer to make, I statrted making some simple crud operations with for my api. After i made most of the functionality in the backend I started combining it with my fronted. This wasn't as hard as I had expeced and the basic functionalities of my project were implementer rather quickly.

### 2 You use software tooling and methodology that continuously monitors and improve the software quality during software development:

### 4 You design and implement a (semi)automated software release process that matches the needs of the project context:

I have started to try and automate the release of my backend. My project builds into a docker container and I am trying to upload it to a Microsoft Azure service but the automatic part of this pipeline isnt working yet. I can manualy puch publish it to the server from visual studio but I still get errors in github.

For the backend of the group project we made 2 backends witch are deployed on a azure server. to make sure every group member could publish their changes I implemented an automated deploy on the main branches of these projects. I had tried this before on my own project and got some errors but after a bit of debugging I got it working and fixed the issue in my own project as well.

### 8 You act in a professional manner during software development and learning:

After every sprint review for the group project we discus with the stakeholders what featueres they would like us to implement in the next sprint. I try to make sure we dont promise to much and sometimes tell them them what we would like to make next.
